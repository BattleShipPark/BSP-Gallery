# BSP-Gallery
This is a personal project for coding practice implementing android gallery with several libraries that I can't use in the company.<br>
I focused on using libraries, not gallery itself.

Libraries that I used are:
- recyclerview
- butterknife
- google analytics
- otto
- picasso
- rxandroid
- lombok

This is only for myself, but I hope it also can be helpful to someone as an example.
