# BSP-Gallery

This is a personal project for coding practice implementing android gallery with several libraries<br>

Libraries that I used are:
- butterknife
- glide
- google analytics
- lombok
- otto
- parceler
- recyclerview
- rxandroid
- rxpermissions

This is only for myself, but I hope it also can be helpful to someone as an example.
